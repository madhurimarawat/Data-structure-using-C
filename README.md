--> C is a general-purpose programming language.<br>
--> C is very fast programming language.<br>
--> It has been used to develop operating systems, databases and applications.<br>
--> It is Procedural Programming language and gives full control to Programmer.

<h1>Data Structures</h1>
--> A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. <br>
--> It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.<br>

<h2>1. Linear data structure:</h2>
<p>Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. </p><br>
<h2>i) Static data structure</h2> 
--> Static data structure has a fixed memory size. <br>
--> It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. <br>
<h2> a) Array</h2>
-->An Array is a sequential collection of elements, of the same data type.<br>
--> They are stored sequentially in memory. An Array is a data structure that holds a similar type of elements.<br><br>
<h2>ii) Dynamic data structure:</h2>
--> Dynamic data structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. <br>
--> It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.<br>
<h2> a) Queue</h2>
--> A Queue is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements.<br>
--> The queue operates on first in first out (FIFO) algorithm.<br>
<h2> b) Stack</h2>
--> A stack is a linear data structure.<br>
--> It follows the last in first out approach.<br>
--> A new item is added at the top of a stack.<br>
--> Both insert and deletion operation is performed from one end of the stack.<br>
<h2> c) Linked List</h2>
--> A Linked List is a data structure.<br>
--> The Linked List is like an array but, the Linked List is not stored sequentially in the memory.<br>
--> Every linked list has 2 parts, the data section and the address section that holds the address of the next element in the list, which is called a node.<br><br>
<h2>2. Non-linear data structure:</h2>
<p>Non-linear data structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. </p>
<h2> a) Tree</h2>
--> A tree is a data structure that has one root node and many sub-nodes.<br>
-->  It is another one of the data structures which are designed on top of a linked list.<br>
<h2> b) Graph</h2>
--> A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. <br>
--> The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.<br>
--> More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ).<br> 
--> The graph is denoted by G(E, V).
